## What you get

- **Every Copilot model** — switch mid-conversation, keep full history
- **Autopilot mode** — agents that plan, code, run tests, and open PRs autonomously
- **Extended thinking** — live reasoning traces from Claude Opus 4.6 and Claude Sonnet 4.6
- **GitHub MCP tools** — issues, PRs, code search, repos — built in
- **Custom MCP servers** — plug in your own
- **Custom webhook tools** — connect any API (Jira, Slack, internal services)
- **File attachments** — drop in code, images, CSVs
- **Persistent sessions** — resume any conversation, on any device
- **CLI ↔ Browser sync** — sessions started in the Copilot CLI work seamlessly in the browser (and vice versa)
- **Mobile-first dark UI** — touch-optimized, works everywhere
- **Self-hosted** — your data never leaves your server

---

## What people do with it

**Build software by talking.** Switch to autopilot, describe what you want, walk away. The agent plans, writes code, runs tests, opens a PR.

> *"Add rate-limiting middleware to the API and write integration tests"* → done. *"Refactor the payment service to handle retries with exponential backoff"* → done.

**Analyze anything.** Drop a CSV, a spreadsheet, a codebase. Ask questions in plain language.

> *"Which product line had the highest return rate last quarter?"* · *"Cluster this support ticket data by root cause"*

**Review PRs from your phone.** Commuting? Ask Copilot to summarize any pull request, flag security issues in the diff, and draft review comments — no laptop needed.

**Compare models on hard problems.** Ask GPT-5.4 for speed, switch to Claude Opus 4.6 for deep reasoning, then Gemini 3 Pro for a different angle. Same conversation, all history preserved.

**Watch it think.** Enable extended thinking on Claude Opus 4.6 or Claude Sonnet 4.6 — see the live reasoning trace in a collapsible block before the answer. You see *how* it gets there, not just what it concludes.

**Connect your own tools.** Define webhook tools in the settings UI. Copilot calls your Jira, your database, your internal APIs — as part of its agentic workflow.

> *"Is the auth bug ticket still open? If so, find the related PRs and summarize the discussion"* → calls your project tracker, then searches GitHub.

**Deploy for your team.** One `azd up`. Everyone logs in with their own GitHub account, gets isolated sessions. No shared API keys, no shared context.

---

## GitHub is the killer feature

Every Copilot model gets native GitHub superpowers — repos, issues, PRs, code search, Actions — all wired in through the GitHub MCP server. No plugins, no tokens to configure, no copy-pasting links. It just knows about your work.

**Spin up a project from an idea — on your phone.**

> *"Create a new public repo called 'invoice-api', scaffold a REST API with JWT auth and a database schema, push the initial commit, and open issues for the billing and PDF export features"*

Done. Repo created, code pushed, issues filed — without touching a laptop.

**Close the loop from idea to pull request.**

> *"Look at the open issues in my main repo, pick the highest-priority bug, implement a fix, run the tests, and open a PR with a clear description"*

The agent reads the repo, writes the code, references the issue, links the PR.

**Cross-repo and org-wide context.**

> *"Find all repos in my org that still use an end-of-life runtime, summarize what each service does, and draft upgrade issues for each one"*

> *"Search all my repos for hardcoded secrets or credentials and show me exactly where they are"*

**PR reviews from anywhere.**

> *"Summarize what this PR changes, flag any security concerns in the diff, and draft inline review comments on the riskiest lines"*

Read that on your commute. Reply, approve, or request changes — without opening VS Code.

**The difference from other AI tools:** ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, and Gemini all work *with* GitHub (you paste in code, you copy out diffs). This works *as* GitHub — the agent creates branches, pushes commits, files PRs, and responds to CI feedback natively, the same way the Copilot CLI does from your terminal, but accessible on any device.

Copilot Pro+ at $39/month is the only way to get GPT-5.4, Claude Opus 4.6, Gemini 3 Pro, and Grok Code Fast 1 through a single subscription — at less than half the cost of buying each service individually. This app runs it all on mobile and desktop with autopilot agents, persistent sessions, and a self-hosted server you control.

## Run it

You need a [GitHub account with Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot#pricing) (free tier works) and a [GitHub OAuth App](https://github.com/settings/developers) (30 seconds — just copy the Client ID).

**Docker** (recommended):

```bash
echo "GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=<your-id>" >> .env
echo "SESSION_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)" >> .env
docker compose up --build
```

**Node.js 24+:**

```bash
npm install && npm run build && npm start
```

**Codespaces** (zero setup):

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/devartifex/copilot-unleashed?quickstart=1)

Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Log in with GitHub. Done.

---

## Deploy to Azure

```bash
azd up
```

That's it. Container Apps, ACR, managed identity, TLS, monitoring — all provisioned automatically.

## Config

| Variable | Required | Default | What it does |
|----------|:--------:|---------|-------------|
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` | yes | — | OAuth App client ID |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | yes | — | Cookie encryption key |
| `PORT` | — | `3000` | Server port |
| `ALLOWED_GITHUB_USERS` | — | — | Restrict access to specific users |
| `BASE_URL` | — | `http://localhost:3000` | Cookie domain + WS origin check |

<details>
<summary>All options</summary>

| Variable | Default | What it does |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `NODE_ENV` | `development` | `production` enables secure cookies |
| `TOKEN_MAX_AGE_MS` | `86400000` | Force re-auth interval (24h) |

| `SETTINGS_STORE_PATH` | `/data/settings` | Per-user settings directory |
| `COPILOT_CONFIG_DIR` | `~/.copilot` | Copilot session-state directory (share with CLI for bidirectional sync) |

</details>

## CLI ↔ Browser session sync

Copilot Unleashed and the GitHub Copilot CLI share the same session-state directory (`~/.copilot/session-state/`). By default, the app reads from the same location the CLI uses — so any session started in the terminal is available in the browser the moment you open the Sessions panel.

### How it works

The `@github/copilot-sdk` stores each session as a folder on disk:

```
~/.copilot/session-state/{session-uuid}/
  workspace.yaml       ← project metadata (cwd, repo, branch, summary)
  plan.md              ← living task list updated as the agent works
  checkpoints/
    index.md           ← checkpoint table of contents
    001_*.md           ← compressed conversation snapshots
    002_*.md
    …
```

When you resume a session from the browser, the SDK's native `resumeSession()` restores the full conversation history and checkpoint context automatically. If the session is only available on disk (e.g. bundled into a Docker image without an active SDK index), the app falls back to reading `workspace.yaml`, `plan.md`, and the last three checkpoint files directly and injecting them as context into a new session — so nothing is lost.

### Sessions panel

The Sessions panel (bottom-left icon) lets you:

- Browse all sessions grouped by repository
- See metadata badges — branch, checkpoint count, plan indicator
- Preview a session before resuming: checkpoint timeline, full `plan.md` content, project path
- Search and filter by title, repository, branch, or directory
- Resume any session with one tap, on any device

### Custom session-state directory

If you want to use a separate directory (e.g. a shared network path or a custom mount in Docker):

```bash
COPILOT_CONFIG_DIR=/data/copilot-state
```

The CLI and Copilot Unleashed will read from and write to the same path. Sessions started in either interface appear in both.

### Docker / Azure deployment

When deploying to a container, mount or copy your local session-state into the image:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
volumes:
  - ~/.copilot:/home/node/.copilot:ro   # read-only mirror of local CLI sessions
```

Or set `COPILOT_CONFIG_DIR` to a shared volume that both your server and the container can access.

---

## How it works

```
Browser ──WebSocket──▶ SvelteKit + server.js ──JSON-RPC──▶ Copilot SDK subprocess
```

1. GitHub Device Flow login → token stored server-side only
2. WebSocket opens → server spawns a `CopilotClient` per user
3. SDK streams events → server forwards as typed JSON → Svelte re-renders in real-time
4. On disconnect → session pooled with TTL, reconnect replays messages

[Architecture docs →](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)

---

## Auth & Security

Device Flow OAuth (same as GitHub CLI). No client secret needed. Tokens are server-side only, never sent to the browser. Sessions are encrypted, rate-limited, and validated against GitHub's API on every WebSocket connect.

Scopes: `copilot` (API access) + `read:user` (avatar) + `repo` (SDK tools need it — same as the CLI).

<details>
<summary>Full security details</summary>

- CSP headers, CSRF protection, HSTS, X-Frame-Options DENY
- Rate limiting: 200 req / 15 min per IP
- Secure cookies: httpOnly, secure (prod), sameSite: lax
- DOMPurify on all rendered markdown
- SSRF blocklist for custom webhook tools
- 10,000 char message limit, 10MB upload limit
- Per-tool permission prompts with 30s auto-deny
- Optional user allowlist via `ALLOWED_GITHUB_USERS`
